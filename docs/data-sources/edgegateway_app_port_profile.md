## Example Usage

data "cloudavenue_edgegateway_app_port_profile" "example" {

## Warning
~> **Scope of app port profile** The app port profile `name` is retrieved with 3 scopes: `tenant`, `provider`, and `system`. If you set the `name` attribute the application port profile is searched with the `tenant` scope if it is not found then it is searched the `Provider`, then `System`. In the IHM the `Provider` scope is named `Custom Applications` with the **no editable** fields and the `System` scope is named `Default Applications`.
