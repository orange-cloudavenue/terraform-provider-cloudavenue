# cloudavenue_vapp_isolated_network (Data Source)

Provides a Cloud Avenue isolated vAPP Network data source to read data or reference existing network.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_vapp" "example" {
  name        = "MyVapp"
  description = "This is an example vApp"
}

resource "cloudavenue_vapp_isolated_network" "example" {
  name                  = "MyVappNet"
  vapp_name             = cloudavenue_vapp.example.name
  gateway               = "192.168.10.1"
  netmask               = "255.255.255.0"
  dns1                  = "192.168.10.1"
  dns_suffix            = "myvapp.biz"
  guest_vlan_allowed    = true
  retain_ip_mac_enabled = true

  static_ip_pool = [{
    start_address = "192.168.10.51"
    end_address   = "192.168.10.101"
    },
    {
      start_address = "192.168.10.10"
      end_address   = "192.168.10.30"
  }]
}

data "cloudavenue_vapp_isolated_network" "example" {
  vapp_name = cloudavenue_vapp.example.name
  name      = cloudavenue_vapp_isolated_network.example.name
}

output "dns" {
  value = cloudavenue_vapp_isolated_network.example.dns2
}
