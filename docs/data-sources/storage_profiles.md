}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `vdc` (String) The name of vDC to use, optional if defined at provider level.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) ID of storage profile.
- `storage_profiles` (Attributes List) List of storage profiles. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--storage_profiles))

### Nested Schema for `storage_profiles`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of storage profile.

Optional:

- `vdc` (String) The name of vDC to use, optional if defined at provider level.

Read-Only:

- `default` (Boolean) Indicates whether this is the default storage profile for the VDC.
- `default_disk_iops` (Number) Value of 0 for disk IOPS means that no IOPS would be reserved or provisioned for that virtual disk.

- `id` (String) ID of storage profile.
- `iops_allocated` (Number) Total IOPS currently allocated to this storage profile.
- `iops_limit` (Number) Maximum number of IOPs that can be allocated for this profile. `0` means `maximum possible`.
- `iops_limiting_enabled` (Boolean) True if this storage profile is IOPS-based placement enabled.
- `limit` (Number) Maximum number of storage bytes (scaled by 'units' field) allocated for this profile. `0` means `maximum possible`.
- `maximum_disk_iops` (Number) The maximum IOPS value that this storage profile is permitted to deliver. Value of 0 means this max setting is disabled and there is no max disk IOPS restriction.
