# cloudavenue_edgegateway_app_port_profile (Resource)

The `cloudavenue_edgegateway_app_port_profile` resource allows you to manage an application port profile.

~> **Notes** The app port profile created is available for the all edge gateways in the your organization. <br>The app port profile `name` is unique in the organization.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway_app_port_profile" "example" {
  name            = "example-rule"
  description     = "Application port profile for example"
  edge_gateway_id = cloudavenue_edgegateway.example.id
  app_ports = [
    {
      protocol = "ICMPv4"
    },
    {
      protocol = "TCP"
      ports = [
        "80",
        "443",
      ]
    },
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `app_ports` (Attributes List) List of application ports. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--app_ports))
- `name` (String) Application Port Profile name. The name is unique within your organization.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Application Port Profile description.
- `edge_gateway_id` (String) (ForceNew) ID of the Edge Gateway. Ensure that one and only one attribute from this collection is set : `edge_gateway_id`, `edge_gateway_name`. This value must start with `urn:vcloud:gateway:`.
- `edge_gateway_name` (String) (ForceNew) Name of the Edge Gateway. Ensure that one and only one attribute from this collection is set : `edge_gateway_id`, `edge_gateway_name`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the App Port profile.

<a id="nestedatt--app_ports"></a>
### Nested Schema for `app_ports`

Required:

- `protocol` (String) Protocol of the application port. Value must be one of : `ICMPv4`, `ICMPv6`, `TCP`, `UDP`.

Optional:

- `ports` (Set of String) Set of destination ports or destination ports ranges. If the value of [`<.protocol`](#<.protocol) attribute is one of `ICMPv4` or `ICMPv6` this attribute is **NULL**. If the value of [`<.protocol`](#<.protocol) attribute is one of `TCP` or `UDP` this attribute is **REQUIRED**.

## Advanced Usage

Reference the App Port Profile in the Firewall Rule.

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway_app_port_profile" "example" {
  name            = "MyApplication"
  description     = "Application port profile for my application"
  edge_gateway_id = cloudavenue_edgegateway.example.id
  app_ports = [
    {
      protocol = "TCP"
      ports = [
        "8080",
      ]
    },
  ]
}

resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway_firewall" "example" {
	edge_gateway_id = cloudavenue_edgegateway.example.id
	rules = [{
		action      = "ALLOW"
		name        = "From Internet to Application example"
		direction   = "IN"
		ip_protocol = "IPV4"
		destination_ids = [cloudavenue_edgegateway_security_group.example.id]
		app_port_profile_ids = [cloudavenue_edgegateway_app_port_profile.example.id]
	}]
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
terraform import cloudavenue.edgegateway_app_port_profile edgegatewayIDOrName.appPortProfileIDOrName
```
