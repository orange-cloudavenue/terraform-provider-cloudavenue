# cloudavenue_network_routed (Resource)

Provides a CloudAvenue Org VDC routed Network. This can be used to create, modify, and delete routed VDC networks.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example" {
  name = "tn01e02ocb0006205spt101"
}

resource "cloudavenue_network_routed" "example" {
  name        = "OrgNetExampleOnVDCGroup"
  description = "Org Net Example"

  edge_gateway_id = data.cloudavenue_edgegateway.example.id

  gateway       = "192.168.1.254"
  prefix_length = 24

  dns1 = "1.1.1.1"
  dns2 = "8.8.8.8"

  dns_suffix = "example"

  static_ip_pool = [
    {
      start_address = "192.168.1.10"
      end_address   = "192.168.1.20"
    }
  ]
}

data "cloudavenue_tier0_vrfs" "example_with_vdc" {}

resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example_with_vdc" {
  owner_name     = "MyVDC"
  tier0_vrf_name = data.cloudavenue_tier0_vrfs.example_with_vdc.names.0
  owner_type     = "vdc"
}

resource "cloudavenue_network_routed" "example" {
  name        = "OrgNetExampleOnVDC"
  description = "Org Net Example"

  edge_gateway_id = cloudavenue_edgegateway.example_with_vdc.id

  gateway       = "192.168.1.254"
  prefix_length = 24

  dns1 = "1.1.1.1"
  dns2 = "8.8.8.8"

  dns_suffix = "example"

  static_ip_pool = [
    {
      start_address = "192.168.1.10"
      end_address   = "192.168.1.20"
    }
  ]
}

## Schema

### Required

- `edge_gateway_id` (String) Edge gateway ID in which Routed network should be located.
- `gateway` (String) (Force replacement) The gateway IP address for the network. This value define also the network IP range with the prefix length.
- `name` (String) The name of the network. This value must be unique within the `VDC` or `VDC Group` that owns the network.
- `prefix_length` (Number) (Force replacement) The prefix length for the network. This value must be a valid prefix length for the network IP range.(e.g. 24 for netmask 255.255.255.0)

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description of the network.
- `dns1` (String) The primary DNS server IP address for the network.
- `dns2` (String) The secondary DNS server IP address for the network.
- `dns_suffix` (String) The DNS suffix for the network.
- `interface_type` (String) Optional interface type (only for NSX-V networks). One of `INTERNAL` (default), `DISTRIBUTED`, `SUBINTERFACE`
- `static_ip_pool` (Attributes Set) A set of static IP pools to be used for this network. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--static_ip_pool))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the network. This is a generated value and cannot be specified during creation. This value is used to identify the network in other resources.

<a id="nestedatt--static_ip_pool"></a>
### Nested Schema for `static_ip_pool`

Required:

- `end_address` (String) The end address of the IP pool. This value must be a valid IP address in the network IP range.
- `start_address` (String) The start address of the IP pool. This value must be a valid IP address in the network IP range.
