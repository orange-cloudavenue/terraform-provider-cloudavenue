# cloudavenue_vcda_ip (Resource)

The VCDa resource allows you to declare or remove your on-premises IP address for the DRaaS service.

 -> Note: For more information, please refer to the [Cloud Avenue DRaaS documentation](https://cloud.orange-business.com/en/offres/infrastructure-iaas/cloud-avenue/wiki-cloud-avenue/services/draas-with-vcda-2/). 

 !> **Resource deprecated** The resource has renamed to [`cloudavenue_draas_onpremise`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/orange-cloudavenue/cloudavenue/latest/docs/resources/draas_onpremise), it will be removed in the version [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/orange-cloudavenue/terraform-provider-cloudavenue/milestone/28) of the provider.

## Migrating from `cloudavenue_vcda_ip` to `cloudavenue_draas_onpremise`

This guide explains how to migrate your Terraform configuration from the legacy resource `cloudavenue_vcda_ip` to the new resource `cloudavenue_draas_onpremise`.  
All fields and attributes are identical between the two resources, so the migration is straightforward.

---

### Why Migrate?

- The `cloudavenue_draas_onpremise` resource replaces `cloudavenue_vcda_ip` for improved naming consistency and future support.
- No changes are required to your resource arguments or values.

---

### Migration Steps

#### 1. Update Resource Type

Replace all occurrences of `cloudavenue_vcda_ip` with `cloudavenue_draas_onpremise` in your `.tf` files.

**Before:**
```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_vcda_ip" "example" {
  ip_address  = "192.168.1.10"
}
```

**After:**
```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_draas_onpremise" "example" {
  ip_address  = "192.168.1.10"
}
```

#### 2. Update References

Update any references to the resource in outputs, data sources, or modules:

**Before:**
```hcl
output "ip" {
  value = cloudavenue_vcda_ip.example.ip_address
}
```

**After:**
```hcl
output "ip" {
  value = cloudavenue_draas_onpremise.example.ip_address
}
```

#### 3. State Migration

To avoid recreating resources, move the Terraform state:

```shell
terraform state mv \
  'cloudavenue_vcda_ip.example' \
  'cloudavenue_draas_onpremise.example'
```

Or, if you use modules or want to move multiple resources, you can use the `moved` block in your module configuration:

```hcl
moved {
  from = cloudavenue_vcda_ip.example
  to   = cloudavenue_draas_onpremise.example
}
```

This technique is especially useful for refactoring modules or moving resources between modules.

---

### Verification

After migration, run:

```shell
terraform plan
```

You should see no changes to infrastructure.  
Then apply to confirm:

```shell
terraform apply
```

---

## Summary

- All fields and arguments remain the same.
- Only the resource type name changes.
- Use `terraform state mv` or the `moved` block to preserve existing resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_vcda_ip" "example" {
  ip_address = "10.0.0.1"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `ip_address` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The on-premises IP address refers to the IP address of your local infrastructure running vCloud Extender. Must be a valid IP with net.ParseIP.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the VCDa resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
# You can import an existing VCDA IP resource with the `ip_address` attribute.

terraform import cloudavenue_vcda_ip.example xx.xx.xx.xx
```
