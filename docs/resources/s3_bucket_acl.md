# cloudavenue_s3_bucket_acl (Resource)

The `cloudavenue_s3_bucket_acl` resource allows you to manage S3 (object storage) buckets ACL (Access Control List).

 ~> `terraform destroy` does not delete the S3 Bucket ACL but does remove the resource from Terraform state.

## Examples Usage

### With canned ACL (private)

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  bucket = data.cloudavenue_s3_bucket.example.id
  acl    = "private"
}
```

### With Grant (public-read)

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  bucket = data.cloudavenue_s3_bucket.example.id

  access_control_policy = {
	grants = [{
	  grantee = {
		type = "Group"
		uri  = "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers"
	  },
	  permission = "READ"
	}]
	owner = {
	  id = "bcaf1ffd86f461ca5fb16fd081034f"
  	}
  }
}
```

### With Grant (private)

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  bucket = data.cloudavenue_s3_bucket.example.name

  access_control_policy = {
	grants = [{
	  grantee = {
		type = "CanonicalUser"
		id  = "bcaf1ffd86f461ca5fb16fd081034f"
	  },
	  permission = "FULL_CONTROL"
	}]
	owner = {
	  id = "bcaf1ffd86f461ca5fb16fd081034f"
  	}
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `bucket` (String) (ForceNew) The Name of the bucket.

### Optional

- `access_control_policy` (Attributes) A configuration block that sets the ACL permissions for an object per grantee. Ensure that if an attribute is set, these are not set: "[access_control_policy,acl]". (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--access_control_policy))
- `acl` (String) (ForceNew) The canned ACL to apply to the bucket. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. [For more information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#specifying-grantee-predefined-acl). Value must be one of : `private`, `public-read`, `public-read-write`, `authenticated-read`, `bucket-owner-read`, `bucket-owner-full-control`. Ensure that if an attribute is set, these are not set: "[access_control_policy,acl]".
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the S3 bucket acl. The ID is same as bucket name.
