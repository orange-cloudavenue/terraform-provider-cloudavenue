# cloudavenue_edgegateway (Resource)

The Edge Gateway resource allows you to create and delete Edge Gateways in Cloud Avenue. EdgeGateway is a virtualized network appliance designed to provide secure connectivity, routing, and network services at the edge of a virtualized environment. It acts as a critical component for managing network traffic between internal virtual networks and external networks, such as the internet or remote sites.

## Examples Usage

### Example with VDC

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example" {
  owner_name = cloudavenue_vdc.example.name
}
```

### Example with VDC Group

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example" {
  owner_name = cloudavenue_vdcg.example.name
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `owner_name` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The name of the Edge Gateway owner. It can be a VDC or a VDC Group name.

### Optional

- `bandwidth` (Number) The bandwidth in `Mbps` of the Edge Gateway. The bandwidth limit in Mbps for the edge gateway. If t0 is `SHARED`, it must be one of the available values for the T0 router, if no value is specified, the bandwidth is automatically calculated based on the remaining bandwidth of the T0. If t0 is `DEDICATED`, unlimited bandwidth is allowed (0 = unlimited). More information can be found [here](#bandwidth-attribute).
- `t0_name` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The name of the T0 Name to which the Edge Gateway is attached. If not specified, the Edge Gateway will be created on the T0 available in your organization. Works if only one T0 Name is available.
- `tier0_vrf_name` (String, Deprecated) The name of the Tier-0 VRF to which the Edge Gateway is attached. If not specified, the Edge Gateway will be created if only one Tier-0 VRF is available. 

 ~> **Attribute deprecated** Rename the `tier0_vrf_name` attribute to `t0_name`, it will be removed in the version [`1.0.0`](https://github.com/orange-cloudavenue/terraform-provider-cloudavenue/milestone/28) of the provider. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/orange-cloudavenue/terraform-provider-cloudavenue/issues/1165) for more information.

### Read-Only

- `description` (String) The description of the Edge Gateway.
- `id` (String) The ID of the Edge Gateway.
- `name` (String) The name of the Edge Gateway.
- `owner_id` (String) The ID of the Edge Gateway owner. It can be a VDC or a VDC Group ID.
- `t0_id` (String) The ID of the T0 to which the Edge Gateway is attached.

## Bandwidth Attribute

The `bandwidth` attribute is optional. If no value is specified, the bandwidth is automatically calculated based on the remaining bandwidth of the Tier-0 VRF. For more information, see the [documentation of edge gateway](https://cloud.orange-business.com/en/offres/infrastructure-iaas/cloud-avenue/wiki-cloud-avenue/services/network/).

The following values are supported depending on the service class of the Tier-0 :

<!-- TABLE BANDWIDTH VALUES -->
* `VRF_DEDICATED_LARGE`(Max: 10000Mbps) : 5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000
* `VRF_DEDICATED_MEDIUM`(Max: 3500Mbps) : 5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000
* `VRF_PREMIUM`(Max: 1000Mbps) : 5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000
* `VRF_STANDARD`(Max: 300Mbps) : 5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300



Example with bandwidth:

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example" {
  owner_name     = cloudavenue_vdc.example.name
  bandwidth      = 100
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
# use the name to import the edge gateway
terraform import cloudavenue_edgegateway.example MyEdgeName
```
