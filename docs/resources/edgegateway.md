```terraform
data "cloudavenue_tier0_vrfs" "example_with_vdc" {}

resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example" {
  tier0_vrf_name = data.cloudavenue_tier0_vrfs.example_with_vdc.names.0
  owner_name     = "MyVDC"
  owner_type     = "vdc"
}
```

- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
