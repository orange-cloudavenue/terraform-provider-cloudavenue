# cloudavenue_edgegateway (Resource)

The Edge Gateway resource allows you to create and delete Edge Gateways in Cloud Avenue.

## Examples Usage

### Example with VDC

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example" {
  owner_name     = cloudavenue_vdc.example.name
  tier0_vrf_name = data.cloudavenue_tier0_vrf.example.name
}
```

### Example with VDC Group

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example" {
  owner_name     = cloudavenue_vdc_group.example.name
  tier0_vrf_name = data.cloudavenue_tier0_vrf.example.name
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `owner_name` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The name of the Edge Gateway owner. It can be a VDC or a VDC Group name.
- `tier0_vrf_name` (String) <i style="color:red;font-weight: bold">(ForceNew)</i> The name of the Tier-0 VRF to which the Edge Gateway is attached.

### Optional

- `bandwidth` (Number) The bandwidth in `Mbps` of the Edge Gateway. If no value is specified, the bandwidth is automatically calculated based on the remaining bandwidth of the Tier-0 VRF. More information can be found [here](#bandwidth-attribute).
- `owner_type` (String, Deprecated) The type of the Edge Gateway owner. Value must be one of : `vdc`, `vdc-group`. 

 ~> **Attribute deprecated** Remove the `owner_type` attribute configuration, it will be removed in the version [`v0.32.0`](https://github.com/orange-cloudavenue/terraform-provider-cloudavenue/milestone/20) of the provider. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/orange-cloudavenue/terraform-provider-cloudavenue/issues/952) for more information.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `description` (String) The description of the Edge Gateway.
- `id` (String) The ID of the Edge Gateway.
- `name` (String) The name of the Edge Gateway.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Bandwidth Attribute

The `bandwidth` attribute is optional. If no value is specified, the bandwidth is automatically calculated based on the remaining bandwidth of the Tier-0 VRF. For more information, see the [documentation of edge gateway](https://wiki.cloudavenue.orange-business.com/wiki/Network).

The following values are supported depending on the service class of the Tier-0 :

<!-- TABLE BANDWIDTH VALUES -->
* `VRF_DEDICATED_LARGE` {10000, [5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000]}
* `VRF_DEDICATED_MEDIUM` {3500, [5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000]}
* `VRF_PREMIUM` {1000, [5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000]}
* `VRF_STANDARD` {300, [5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300]}



Example with bandwidth:

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example" {
  owner_name     = cloudavenue_vdc.example.name
  tier0_vrf_name = data.cloudavenue_tier0_vrf.example.name
  bandwidth      = 100
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
# use the name to import the edge gateway
terraform import cloudavenue_edgegateway.example MyEdgeName
```
