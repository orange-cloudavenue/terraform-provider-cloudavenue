# cloudavenue_edgegateway (Resource)

The Edge Gateway resource allows you to create and delete Edge Gateways in Cloud Avenue.

## Examples Usage

### Example with VDC

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example" {
  owner_name     = cloudavenue_vdc.example.name
  tier0_vrf_name = data.cloudavenue_tier0_vrf.example.name
  owner_type     = "vdc"
}
```

### Example with VDC Group

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example" {
  owner_name     = cloudavenue_vdc_group.example.name
  tier0_vrf_name = data.cloudavenue_tier0_vrf.example.name
  owner_type     = "vdc-group"
}
```

- `tier0_vrf_name` (String) (ForceNew) The name of the Tier-0 VRF to which the Edge Gateway is attached.

### Optional

- `bandwidth` (Number) The bandwidth in Mbps of the Edge Gateway. If no value is not specified, the bandwidth is automatically calculated based on the remaining bandwidth of the Tier-0 VRF.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
