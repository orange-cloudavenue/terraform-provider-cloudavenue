The virtual machine (vm) resource allows you to manage a virtual machine in the CloudAvenue.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_vapp" "example" {
  name        = "vapp_example"
  description = "This is a example vapp"
}

resource "cloudavenue_vm_disk" "example-detachable" {
  vapp_id       = cloudavenue_vapp.example.id
  name          = "disk-example"
  bus_type      = "SATA"
  size_in_mb    = 2048
  is_detachable = true
}
```

- `vdc` (String) (ForceNew) The name of vDC to use, optional if defined at provider level.
- `vm_id` (String) The ID of the VM where the disk will be attached. Value must satisfy at least one of the validations: If is_detachable attribute is set and the value is one of false, this attribute is REQUIRED + Ensure that one and only one attribute from this collection is set: "[vm_name]".
- `vm_name` (String) The name of the VM where the disk will be attached. Value must satisfy at least one of the validations: If is_detachable attribute is set and the value is one of false, this attribute is REQUIRED + Ensure that one and only one attribute from this collection is set: "[vm_id]".

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the VM.
