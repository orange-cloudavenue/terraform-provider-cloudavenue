# cloudavenue_vm_disk (Resource)

The virtual machine (vm) resource allows you to manage a virtual machine in the CloudAvenue.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_vapp" "example" {
  name        = "vapp_example"
  description = "This is a example vapp"
}

resource "cloudavenue_vm_disk" "example-detachable" {
  vapp_id       = cloudavenue_vapp.example.id
  name          = "disk-example"
  bus_type      = "SATA"
  size_in_mb    = 2048
  is_detachable = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `size_in_mb` (Number) The size of the disk in MB.

### Optional

- `bus_number` (Number) The bus number of the disk controller. Is the disk is attached to a VM and this attribute is not set, the disk will be attached to the first available bus. Value must be between 0 and 3.
- `bus_type` (String) The type of disk controller. Value must be one of : `IDE`, `SATA`, `SCSI`, `NVME`. Value defaults to `SCSI`.
- `name` (String) The name of the disk. If "is_detachable" attribute is set and the value is one of `true`, this attribute is required.
- `storage_profile` (String) The name of the storage profile. If not set, the default storage profile will be used. Value must be one of : `silver`, `silver_r1`, `silver_r2`, `gold`, `gold_r1`, `gold_r2`, `gold_hm`, `platinum3k`, `platinum3k_r1`, `platinum3k_r2`, `platinum3k_hm`, `platinum7k`, `platinum7k_r1`, `platinum7k_r2`, `platinum7k_hm`.
- `unit_number` (Number) The unit number of the disk controller. Is the disk is attached to a VM and this attribute is not set, the disk will be attached to the first available unit. Value must be between 0 and 15.
- `vapp_id` (String) (ForceNew) ID of the vApp. Ensure that one and only one attribute from this collection is set : `vapp_name`, `vapp_id`.
- `vapp_name` (String) (ForceNew) Name of the vApp. Ensure that one and only one attribute from this collection is set : `vapp_id`, `vapp_name`.
- `vdc` (String) (ForceNew) The name of vDC to use, optional if defined at provider level.
- `vm_id` (String) The ID of the VM where the disk will be attached. Value must satisfy at least one of the validations: If "is_detachable" attribute is set and the value is one of "false", this attribute is required + Ensure that one and only one attribute from this collection is set: "[vm_name]".
- `vm_name` (String) The name of the VM where the disk will be attached. Value must satisfy at least one of the validations: If "is_detachable" attribute is set and the value is one of "false", this attribute is required + Ensure that one and only one attribute from this collection is set: "[vm_id]".

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the VM.
- `is_detachable` (Boolean) If set to `true`, the disk will be detached from the VM. If set to `false`, the disk will be attached to the VM. If `vm_id` is not set, the disk will be attached to any VM. Value defaults to `false`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
# use the id to import the resource
terraform import cloudavenue_vm_disk.example id
```
