# cloudavenue_vdc (Resource)

Provides a Cloud Avenue vDC (Virtual Data Center) resource. This can be used to create, update and delete vDC.
 
 -> Note: For more information about Cloud Avenue vDC, please refer to the [Cloud Avenue documentation](https://wiki.cloudavenue.orange-business.com/wiki/Datacenter_virtuel).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_vdc" "example" {
  name                  = "MyVDC"
  vdc_group             = "MyVDCGroup"
  description           = "Example VDC created by Terraform"
  cpu_allocated         = 6000
  memory_allocated      = 10
  cpu_speed_in_mhz      = 1200
  billing_model         = "PAYG"
  disponibility_class   = "ONE-ROOM"
  service_class         = "STD"
  storage_billing_model = "PAYG"

  storage_profiles = [
    {
      class   = "gold"
      default = true
      limit   = 500
    },
    {
      class   = "silver"
      default = false
      limit   = 500
    },
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `billing_model` (String) Choose Billing model of compute resources.
- `cpu_allocated` (Number) CPU capacity in *MHz* that is committed to be available or used as a limit in PAYG mode.

 -> Note: Reserved capacity is automatically set according to the service class.
- `cpu_speed_in_mhz` (Number) Specifies the clock frequency, in Mhz, for any virtual CPU that is allocated to a VM.
- `disponibility_class` (String) The disponibility class of the vDC.
- `memory_allocated` (Number) Memory capacity in Gb that is committed to be available or used as a limit in PAYG mode.
- `name` (String) The name of the vDC.
- `service_class` (String) The service class of the vDC.
- `storage_billing_model` (String) Choose Billing model of storage resources.
- `storage_profiles` (Attributes Set) List of storage profiles for this vDC. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--storage_profiles))
- `vdc_group` (String) vDC group name.This can be an existing vDC group or a new one. This allows you to isolate your vDC.
VMs of vDCs which belong to the same vDC group can communicate together.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description of the vDC.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the vDC.

<a id="nestedatt--storage_profiles"></a>
### Nested Schema for `storage_profiles`

Required:

- `class` (String) The storage class of the storage profile.
- `default` (Boolean) Set this storage profile as default for this vDC. Only one storage profile can be default per vDC.
- `limit` (Number) Max number in *Gb* of units allocated for this storage profile.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `read` (String)
- `update` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
# VDC can be imported using the name.

terraform import cloudavenue_vdc.example name
```
