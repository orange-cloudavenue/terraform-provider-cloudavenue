# cloudavenue_vdc (Resource)

Provides a Cloud Avenue Organization VDC resource. This can be used to create, update and delete an Organization VDC. -> Note: For more information about Organization VDC, please refer to the [Cloud Avenue documentation](https://wiki.cloudavenue.orange-business.com/w/index.php/Datacenter_virtuel).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_vdc" "example" {
  name                  = "MyVDC"
  vdc_group             = "MyVDCGroup"
  description           = "Example VDC created by Terraform"
  cpu_allocated         = 6000
  memory_allocated      = 10
  cpu_speed_in_mhz      = 1200
  billing_model         = "PAYG"
  disponibility_class   = "ONE-ROOM"
  service_class         = "STD"
  storage_billing_model = "PAYG"

  storage_profile {
    class   = "gold"
    default = true
    limit   = 500
  }

  storage_profile {
    class   = "silver"
    default = false
    limit   = 500
  }

}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `billing_model` (String) Choose Billing model of compute resources. It can be `PAYG`, `DRAAS` or `RESERVED`.
- `cpu_allocated` (Number) CPU capacity in *MHz* that is committed to be available or used as a limit in PAYG mode.
It must be at least 5 * `cpu_speed_in_mhz`.

 -> Note: Reserved capacity is automatically set according to the service class.
- `cpu_speed_in_mhz` (Number) Specifies the clock frequency, in Mhz, for any virtual CPU that is allocated to a VM.
It must be at least 1200.
- `disponibility_class` (String) The disponibility class of the org VDC. It can be `ONE-ROOM`, `DUAL-ROOM` or `HA-DUAL-ROOM`.
- `memory_allocated` (Number) Memory capacity in Gb that is committed to be available or used as a limit in PAYG mode.
It must be between 1 and 5000.
- `name` (String) The name of the org VDC. It must be unique in the organization.
The length must be between 2 and 27 characters.
Changes to this field will force a new resource to be created.
- `service_class` (String) The service class of the org VDC. It can be `ECO`, `STD`, `HP` or `VOIP`.
- `storage_billing_model` (String) Choose Billing model of storage resources. It can be `PAYG` or `RESERVED`.
- `vdc_group` (String) Name of an existing VDC group or a new one. This allows you to isolate your VDC.
VMs of VDCs which belong to the same VDC group can communicate together.
Changes to this field will force a new resource to be created.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the org VDC.
- `storage_profile` (Block List) List of storage profiles for this VDC. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--storage_profile))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) ID is the Name of the VCD.

<a id="nestedblock--storage_profile"></a>
### Nested Schema for `storage_profile`

Required:

- `class` (String) The storage class of the storage profile.
It can be `silver`, `silver_r1`, `silver_r2`, `gold`, `gold_r1`, `gold_r2`, `gold_hm`, `platinum3k`, `platinum3k_r1`, `platinum3k_r2`, `platinum3k_hm`, `platinum7k`, `platinum7k_r1`, `platinum7k_r2`, `platinum7k_hm`.
- `default` (Boolean) Set this storage profile as default for this VDC. Only one storage profile can be default per VDC.
- `limit` (Number) Max number of units allocated for this storage profile. In Gb. It must be between 500 and 10000.


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `read` (String)
- `update` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# VDC can be imported using the name.

terraform import cloudavenue_vdc.vdc name
```
