If the vApp is in a powered on state, the resource will power OFF the vApp before deleting the resource and then power it back on.
On power **ALL** VMs in the vApp will be powered ON, regardless of their previous state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "cloudavenue_tier0_vrfs" "example" {}

resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway" "example" {
  owner_name     = "MyVDC"
  tier0_vrf_name = data.cloudavenue_tier0_vrfs.example.names.0
  owner_type     = "vdc"
}

resource "cloudavenue_network_routed" "example" {
  name        = "MyOrgNet"
  description = "This is an example Net"

  edge_gateway_id = cloudavenue_edgegateway.example.id

  gateway       = "192.168.1.254"
  prefix_length = 24

  dns1 = "1.1.1.1"
  dns2 = "8.8.8.8"

  dns_suffix = "example"

  static_ip_pool = [
    {
      start_address = "192.168.1.10"
      end_address   = "192.168.1.20"
    }
  ]
}

resource "cloudavenue_vapp" "example" {
  name        = "MyVapp"
  description = "This is an example vApp"
  vdc         = "MyVDC"
}

resource "cloudavenue_vapp_org_network" "example" {
  vapp_name    = cloudavenue_vapp.example.name
  network_name = cloudavenue_network_routed.example.name
