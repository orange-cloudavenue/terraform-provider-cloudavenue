# cloudavenue_edgegateway_firewall (Resource)

The firewall resource allows you to manage rules on an Firewall.

## Examples Usage

### Basic Example

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway_firewall" "example" {
  edge_gateway_id = cloudavenue_edgegateway.example.id
  rules = [
    {
      action      = "ALLOW"
      name        = "allow all IPv4 traffic"
      direction   = "IN_OUT"
      ip_protocol = "IPV4"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Advanced Example

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway_firewall" "example" {
  edge_gateway_id = cloudavenue_edgegateway.example.id
  rules = [
    {
  	  action      = "ALLOW"
  	  name        = "allow all IPv4 traffic"
  	  direction   = "IN_OUT"
  	  ip_protocol = "IPV4"
    },
    {
  	  action      = "ALLOW"
  	  name        = "allow OUT IPv4 traffic"
  	  direction   = "OUT"
  	  ip_protocol = "IPV4"
    }
  ]
}
```
