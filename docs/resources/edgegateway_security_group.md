# cloudavenue_edgegateway_security_group (Resource)

The Security Group resource allows you to manage an security group in an Edge Gateway. Security Groups are groups of data center group networks to which firewall rules apply. Grouping networks helps you to reduce the total number of firewall rules to be created.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_edgegateway_security_group" "example" {
  edge_gateway_id = data.cloudavenue_edgegateways.example.edge_gateways[0].id
  name            = "example"
  description     = "This is an example security group"
  member_org_network_ids = [
    cloudavenue_network_routed.example.id
  ]
}

data "cloudavenue_edgegateways" "example" {}

resource "cloudavenue_network_routed" "example" {
  name        = "MyOrgNet"
  description = "This is an example Net"

  edge_gateway_id = data.cloudavenue_edgegateways.example.edge_gateways[0].id

  gateway       = "192.168.1.254"
  prefix_length = 24

  dns1 = "1.1.1.1"
  dns2 = "8.8.8.8"

  dns_suffix = "example"

  static_ip_pool = [
    {
      start_address = "192.168.1.10"
      end_address   = "192.168.1.20"
    }
  ]
}
```
