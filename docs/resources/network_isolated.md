# cloudavenue_network_isolated (Resource)

Provides a Cloud Avenue VDC isolated Network. This can be used to create, modify, and delete VDC isolated networks. 

 !> **Resource deprecated** The resource has renamed to [`cloudavenue_vdc_network_isolated`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/orange-cloudavenue/cloudavenue/latest/docs/resources/vdc_network_isolated), it will be removed in the version [`v0.32.0`](https://github.com/orange-cloudavenue/terraform-provider-cloudavenue/milestone/20) of the provider. See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/orange-cloudavenue/terraform-provider-cloudavenue/issues/880) for more information.


## How to migrate existing resources

Original configuration:

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_network_isolated" "example" {
  name = "my-isolated-network"
  vdc  = cloudavenue_vdc.example.name

  gateway       = "192.168.0.1"
  prefix_length = 24

  dns1       = "192.168.0.2"
  dns2       = "192.168.0.3"
  dns_suffix = "example.local"
}
```

Migrated configuration:

Rename the resource to `cloudavenue_vdc_network_isolated` and add the `moved` block to the configuration:

```hcl
resource "cloudavenue_vdc_network_isolated" "example" {
  name = "my-isolated-network"
  vdc  = cloudavenue_vdc.example.name

  gateway       = "192.168.0.1"
  prefix_length = 24

  dns1       = "192.168.0.2"
  dns2       = "192.168.0.3"
  dns_suffix = "example.local"
}

moved {
  from = cloudavenue_network_isolated.example
  to   = cloudavenue_vdc_network_isolated.example
}
```

Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to migrate the resource.

Example of terraform plan output:

```shell
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # cloudavenue_network_isolated.example has moved to cloudavenue_vdc_network_isolated.example
    resource "cloudavenue_vdc_network_isolated" "example" {
        id                 = "urn:vcloud:network:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
        name               = "rsx-example-isolated-network"
        # (9 unchanged attributes hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_network_isolated" "example" {
  name = "my-isolated-network"
  vdc  = cloudavenue_vdc.example.name

  gateway       = "192.168.0.1"
  prefix_length = 24

  dns1       = "192.168.0.2"
  dns2       = "192.168.0.3"
  dns_suffix = "example.local"
}
```

- `name` (String) The name of the network. This value must be unique within the `VDC` or `VDC Group` that owns the network.
- `prefix_length` (Number) (ForceNew) The prefix length for the network. This value must be a valid prefix length for the network IP range. (e.g. /24 for netmask 255.255.255.0). Value must be between 1 and 32.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description of the network.
- `dns1` (String) The primary DNS server IP address for the network. Must be a valid IP with net.ParseIP.
- `dns2` (String) The secondary DNS server IP address for the network. Must be a valid IP with net.ParseIP.
- `dns_suffix` (String) The DNS suffix for the network.
- `static_ip_pool` (Attributes Set) A set of static IP pools to be used for this network. Set must contain at least 1 elements. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--static_ip_pool))
- `vdc` (String) (ForceNew) The name of vDC to use, optional if defined at provider level.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the network.

<a id="nestedatt--static_ip_pool"></a>
### Nested Schema for `static_ip_pool`

Required:

- `end_address` (String) The end address of the IP pool. This value must be a valid IP address in the network IP range. Must be a valid IP with net.ParseIP.
