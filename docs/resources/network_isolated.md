# cloudavenue_network_isolated (Resource)

Provides a Cloud Avenue Org VDC isolated Network. This can be used to create, modify, and delete isolated VDC networks

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudavenue_network_isolated" "example" {
  vdc         = "VDC_Test"
  name        = "rsx-example-isolated-network"
  description = "My isolated Org VDC network"

  gateway       = "1.1.1.1"
  prefix_length = 24

  dns1       = "8.8.8.8"
  dns2       = "8.8.4.4"
  dns_suffix = "example.com"

  static_ip_pool = [
    {
      start_address = "1.1.1.10"
      end_address   = "1.1.1.20"
    },
    {
      start_address = "1.1.1.100"
      end_address   = "1.1.1.103"
    }
  ]
}

- `prefix_length` (Number) (Force replacement) The prefix length for the network. This value must be a valid prefix length for the network IP range.(e.g. /24 for netmask 255.255.255.0)

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description of the network.
- `dns1` (String) The primary DNS server IP address for the network.
- `dns2` (String) The secondary DNS server IP address for the network.
- `dns_suffix` (String) The DNS suffix for the network.
- `static_ip_pool` (Attributes Set) A set of static IP pools to be used for this network. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--static_ip_pool))
- `vdc` (String) (ForceNew) The name of vDC to use, optional if defined at provider level.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the network. This is a generated value and cannot be specified during creation. This value is used to identify the network in other resources.
