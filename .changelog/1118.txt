```release-note:bug
`provider`: All mutex locking/unlocking for Edge Gateway and related resources now use a single consistent key: URN (extracted UUID). 
This prevents concurrency bugs where the same Edge Gateway could be locked with different keys. 
Removed redundant lock utility functions and ensured all resources (firewall, network, etc.) use the same lock logic.
