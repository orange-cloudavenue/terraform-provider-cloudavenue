```release-note:feature
`cloudavenue_edgegateway_firewall` - Added new attributes `source_ip_address` and `destination_ip_address` to the `rule` property. These attributes allow you to specify the source and destination IP addresses for firewall rules. This enhancement provides more granular control over firewall rules, enabling users to define specific IP addresses for both source and destination in their edge gateway firewall configurations.
