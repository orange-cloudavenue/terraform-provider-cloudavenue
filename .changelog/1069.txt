```release-note:bug
`resource/cloudavenue_edgegateway` - Implement a workaround to deactivate the calculation of remaining bandwidth and prevent its configuration when the T0 VRF has a class of service set to DEDICATED. This workaround addresses a bug in the API and will be removed once the API issue is resolved.
