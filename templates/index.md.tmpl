## Provider Configuration

 !> Hard-coded credentials are not recommended in any Terraform configuration and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a public version control system.

Credentials can be provided by adding an `org`, `user`, and `password`, to the cloudavenue provider block.

Usage :

```terraform
provider "cloudavenue" {
  org      = var.org
  user     = var.user

}
```

Other settings related to [Schema](#schema) can be configured.
