 !> The environment variables override the provider configuration.

## Schema

## Provider Configuration

 !> Hard-coded credentials are not recommended in any Terraform configuration and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a public version control system.

Credentials can be provided by adding an `org`, `user`, and `password`, to the cloudavenue provider block.

Usage :

```terraform
provider "cloudavenue" {
  org      = var.org
  user     = var.user
  password = var.password
}
```

Other settings related to [Schema](#schema) can be configured.

## Environment Variables

 !> [DEPRECATED] (Breaking Change Upcoming): The 'vdc' variable is now deprecated (since `v0.34.0`) and will be removed in `v0.39.0`.

Credentials can be provided by using the environment variables related to [List of Environment Variables](#list-of-environment-variables).
It's recommended to use environment variables to avoid hard-coding credentials in any Terraform configuration and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a public version control system.

For example:
  
```terraform
provider "cloudavenue" {}
```

```bash
export CLOUDAVENUE_ORG="my-org"
export CLOUDAVENUE_USERNAME="my-user"
export CLOUDAVENUE_PASSWORD="my-password"
```
