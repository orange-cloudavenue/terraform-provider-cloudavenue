## Authentication

Cloud Avenue support authentication with username, password and organization.

## Known Limitations

Because of the way Cloud Avenue API works, it is not possible to work on many resources at the same time.
This means that if you have a Terraform configuration with multiple resources, you will need to run `terraform apply -parallelism=1` or `terraform destroy -parallelism=1`.
